# High Order Calculator (HOC)

## Overview

The High Order Calculator (HOC) is a powerful and versatile calculator designed to handle a variety of mathematical operations, including high-order functions. Whether you're dealing with complex expressions, function compositions, or need a robust calculation tool, HOC provides the functionality you need.

## Problem
This calculator is based on the UNIX programming material. It goes just at the stage 3. On this stage there are 
semantical problems on the grammar. This issues belongs to the way that the grammar is described on the book,
it doesn't have the terms or expression order.

For example:

2+2*3/4-5

This expression have issues on the order of the operands, because on the grammar theres no way to difference 
a term (*,/,%,^) of an expression (+,-)

Solve this issue is the goal of the Vegas Version.
## Features

- **High-order Function Support**: Perform operations on functions themselves, including composition and transformation.
- **Complex Expressions**: Handle intricate mathematical expressions with ease.

## Installation
